										<p>As we enter a new year, it's important to stay informed about the latest web design trends. The world of web design is constantly evolving, and staying on top of the latest trends can help set your designs apart and keep them looking fresh and modern. In this article, we'll take a look at some of the most popular web design trends for 2023. From scrapbook and DIY design and micro-animation to pixelation, these trends are sure to make a big impact on the world of web design in the coming year.</p>

										<h3>Interactivity</h3>
										<p>Last year brought the welcome retirement of Internet Explorer and now with far better web browser support capabilities web interactivity has greatly improved. Interactive elements such as Animated cursors, micro animations, and parallax zoom scrolling can help make a website more engaging and immersive for users. This can lead to increased time spent on the site, which can help to improve SEO rankings and overall user satisfaction.</p>

										<h3>Micro-Animation</h3>
										<p>Micro-animations, also known as micro-interactions, are small animations that are used to provide feedback to users. These animations can be used to indicate that a button has been pressed, or to indicate that a piece of content is loading. Micro-animations can help to improve the overall user experience by providing visual feedback that help users understand what is happening on the website.</p>

										<h3>Text-Only Hero Section</h3>
										<p>The hero section is a very prominent section of a website, often the first thing users see when they land on a page just after your logo and main menu. The trend of utilising oversized background images is becoming obsolete in the current year, with a shift towards text-based hero sections that employ large typography and minimalistic design for a striking and impactful initial impression. Adopting this trend can result in a clean and modern aesthetic, while also improving accessibility for users with visual impairments and enhancing page loading times.</p>

										<p>Instead of using Stoke Photography Custom illustrations can help to create a more unique and memorable visual identity for a website. Instead of using stock images, custom illustrations can be created to perfectly match the branding and style of a website. This can help to make a website stand out and create a strong emotional connection with users.</p>

										<h3>White Space</h3>
										<p>White space, also known as negative space, is the empty space between design elements. In web design, white space can be used to create a clean and uncluttered look. This can help to make a website look more modern and professional, and can also help to improve readability by making it easier for users to focus on the content.</p>
